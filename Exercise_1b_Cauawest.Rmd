```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

**Data generation**

Here, we create a vector of 100 random numbers from a log-normal distribution

mu=1

sigma=0.25

```{r}
#Seed is set for reproducibility
set.seed(42)
#Random naumbers generation
random_numbers<-rlnorm(n = 100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = 0.25)
```

**Plot Generation**

Here, we create a histogram and a scatterplot of random_numbers on the log scale:
```{r}
#Histogram
hist(log(random_numbers))
#Scatterplot
plot(log(random_numbers))
```

**Mean and variance**

Here, we calculate the mean and the variance of the sample:

```{r}
#Mean
mean(random_numbers)
#Variance
var(random_numbers)
```
Mean is 2.830188

Variance is 0.495925
